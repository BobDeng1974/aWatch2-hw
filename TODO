ALIVE:
  * FTDI UART is alive (modulo known issue below with voltages)
  * SWD is alive using ST-LINK v2
  * nRF52840 CPU is alive
  * nRF52840 high-speed crystal is alive
  * nRF52840 radio (Bluetooth LE) is alive
  * MAX14745 is alive and speaking I2C, buck regulator is alive
  * IMU is alive and speaking I2C
  * Pressure sensor is alive and speaking I2C

STILL TO CHECK OUT:
  * buttons
  * LEDs
  * display
  * Maxim LDO
  * Maxim charge circuitry
  * QSPI flash
  * microphone
  * magnetometer
  * vibrate driver
  * nRF52840 DC-DC buck converter

KNOWN ISSUES:
  * FTDI needs VDDIO tied to +3.3, and needs level shifter
  * FTDI SWD resistor is on wrong pin
  * display connector is rotated 180 degrees (should be OK because display connector is dual contact)
  * ambient light sensor footprint is mirrored
  * manufacturability issues on vias for SWD and PMIC I2C buses leading to shorts; vias should be moved further apart (can be worked around with scalpel on current revision boards)
  * I can't figure out where I put the third board from the first run
