MUST USE 14745 instead of 14690 -- 14690 cannot change buck2 after boot!
14745 has different register mapping than 14690!

Digikey has 100 MAX14745-FEWX+
  BUCK2 = 1.8V

Mouser has 100 MAX14690A
  BUCK2 = 1.8V

Digikey has 100 MAX20335A
  BUCK2 = 1.8V

MAX20345 for future awatch designs that need step-up for MAX30102 HRM
